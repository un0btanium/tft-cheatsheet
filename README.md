# TFT CheatSheet

Website: https://un0btanium.github.io/tft-cheatsheet/

This React web application for the League of Legends Teamfight Tactics gamemode provides you with a fast overview of your items and chamions. It shows you which options you have when it comes to combining them into more advanced ones. Add and remove items/champions with ease and see everything you need to know via many customizable highlighting features.

I created this project in my freetime, because most of the other tools I found on the internet were always lacking in one or two aspects, so I took it upon myself to create a tool which would fit my needs. The result is still work in progress, but already shared on this website for everyone to use. I hope that it will help you to learn and improve as well as concentrate on the more important aspects of the game.
